# aviatrix_gateway

The Account resource allows the creation and management of an Aviatrix gateway.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create Aviatrix AWS gateway
resource "aviatrix_gateway" "test_gateway1" {
  cloud_type = 1
  account_name = "devops"
  gw_name = "avtxgw1"
  vpc_id = "vpc-abcdef"
  vpc_reg = "us-west-1"
  vpc_size = "t2.micro"
  vpc_net = "10.0.0.0/24"
  tag_list = ["k1:v1","k2:v2"]
}
```
